# First 2D Game

This is my first attempt at a simple 2D game built in Java.

## 🎮 Game Concepts
For right now it is fairly simple as im getting
a hang of how to create a game in java.
the character is controlled with WASD and 
there are 2 enemies that spawn and move towards you

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the game:

    Navigate to and run:
    
    src/Main/Main.java

That’s it, the game should start!
